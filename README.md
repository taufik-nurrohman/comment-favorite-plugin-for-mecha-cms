Comment Favorite Plugin for Mecha CMS
=====================================

> Give a special mark on any comments that you consider important or interesting.

On the comments manager page, edit the comment you want to mark it as a favorite. Once you get into the comment editor, click on the **Fields** tab, then check the custom field that reads _Mark as Favorite_.

Upload the `comment-favorite` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
